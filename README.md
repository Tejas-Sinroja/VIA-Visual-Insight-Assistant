### Developed a deep learning-based system to identify food items from images, focusing on the food domain.
### Designed and improved the model architecture iteratively over four versions, culminating in a robust classification system.
### Utilized CNN-based custom architectures and fine-tuned the Inception V3 pretrained model for comparative analysis.
### Trained the models on a dataset of over 5,000 images spanning 20 food classes, achieving high accuracy in classification.
### Incorporated nutrition data (e.g., protein, calories) for each identified food item, offering dietary suggestions based on user preferences or restrictions.
### Successfully deployed the solution on Streamlit Cloud, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time food identification and recommendations.
